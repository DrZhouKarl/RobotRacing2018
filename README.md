### Description:

    This repository contains the current competition code (2018). This code is used for the IARRC 2018. This code currently handles LIDAR
    mapping, trajectory rollout, PID speed control, lane detection and traffic light detection.
    
### Moving forward:
    This code base should be integrated with the overall UWRobotics code such that modularity can be achieved?
